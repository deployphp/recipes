# Local recipe

This recipe is a re-implementation of `common.php` recipe, for running some of the tasks locally instead of remotelly. This recipe is especially useful if hosting provider that You're deploying to has some limitations of what can/can't be run. Best example is a *Shared Hosting* environment.

### Installing

```php
// deploy.php

require 'vendor/deployphp/recipes/recipes/local.php';
```

### Configuration options

The `local.php` uses the same options as the standard `common.php` recipe and a few specific options.

- **local**: Accepts an array with the following local options (all are optional and defaults are ok):

- *timeout*: accepts an *int* defining the timeout for the local command.

#### Sample Configuration:

Following is default configuration.

```php
// deploy.php

set('local',[
    'timeout'      => 60,
]);
```

### Environmental variables

- **local_deploy_path** - Accepts *string* specifying from where should deploys be done. This is functionally identical with `deploy_path` of `common.php` recipe.

```php
env('local_deploy_path', '/tmp/deployer');
```
#### Additional/relative env variables

- **local_release_path** - Accepts *string* specifying from where should deploys be done. This is functionally identical with `release_path` of `common.php` recipe. If You use full local release scenario, You do **not** wish to set this, as it's relative to `local_deploy_path`.
- **local_git_cache** - Accepts *boolean*. By default it checks if Your git version supports required options (minimum git version is 2.3). If You do not use release workflow, You would not see benefits to this option. Set this to false to use shallow clones, that slims down cloned repository size.

### Tasks

- `local:prepare` - Prepares local dirs for deployment. Instead of failing when `local_deploy_path` does not exist - tries to create it.
- `local:release` - Prepare release directory
- `local:update_code` - Clones repository into local release directory
- `local:vendors` - Run composer locally in release directory
- `local:symlink` - Symlink atomicly to newest release
- `local:current` - Show current symlinked release
- `local:cleanup` - Cleanup local releases.


### Suggested Usage

Depending on what *actually* is possible on remote deploy target or if You want to test deployment locally, there's many ways to utilize this recipe.

#### Scenario #1

You just want to clone locally and run composer locally. Everything else can be done remotelly.

This can be set as follows:

```php
// deploy.php

env('local_release_path', '/tmp/my_application');

/**
 * Main task
 */
task('deploy', [
    'deploy:prepare',
    'deploy:release',
    'local:update_code',
    'local:vendors',
    'deploy:symlink',
    'cleanup',
])->desc('Deploy your project');

after('local:vendors', function() {
    upload(env('local_release_path'), env('release_path'));
})->desc('Upload local to remote');
```

#### Scenario #2

You use full local release *and* full remote release. Plus You wish to take advantage of `rsync.php` recipe.

```php
env('rsync_src', function() {
    $local_src = env('local_release_path');
    if(is_callable($local_src)){
        $local_src = $local_src();
    }
    return $local_src;
});

task('deploy', [
    'local:prepare',
    'deploy:prepare',
    'local:release',
    'deploy:release',
    'rsync:warmup',
    'local:update_code',
    'rsync',
    'local:symlink',
    'deploy:symlink',
    'cleanup',
    'local:cleanup'
])->desc('Deploy your project');

```
