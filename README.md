## Contributing a recipe

All code contributions must go through a pull request and be approved by a core developer before being merged.
This is to ensure proper review of all the code.

* [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
* Create a branch.
  * If the recipe is for Deployer `4.x` then create your branch based on `master`
  * If the recipe is for Deployer `3.x` then create your branch based on `3.x`
  * If the recipe is for Deployer `2.x` then create your branch based on the `2.x` branch
* Add your recipe to the `recipes` folder, it must be licensed as MIT.
* Add documentation in Markdown for your recipe to the `docs` folder; you could base your documentation on
[cachetool.md](docs/cachetool.md) as it is fairly complete.
* Add your recipe to the table above in `README.md`. Please use alphabetical order.
* Commit, push and send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* You can use the documentation of your recipe as a description for your pull request.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows
[PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

### Recipe Do's and Don'ts

For easier integration in existing projects and fewer changes in your recipe (and/or docs for it) you should try and
follow these general guidelines:

* Use short file names for recipes, e.g. `ftp` instead of `ftp_upload_to_server_recipe_by_me`
* Prefix all tasks in recipe with your recipe name. If you have a task named `mytest` in
`myrecipe` it should be named `myrecipe:mytest`
* Use global settings prefixed by your recipe name. If you have one setting, give it the same name as your recipe.
If you have multiple settings, use an associative array
* Use environment variables prefixed by your recipe name. If you have an environment variable named `better_path`
in recipe `myrecipe`, call it `myrecipe_better_path`
* Do not override existing tasks (for example those in `common.php`). Instead document thoroughly how tasks from your
recipe can be integrated into the workflow
* If your recipe depends on another (be it included in deployer or 3rd party) document it thoroughly.
It's better for the end user to use `require_once` in `deploy.php` than to force dependencies.
