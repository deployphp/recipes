* [Fork and clone](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo).
* Create a branch.
  * If the recipe is for Deployer `3.x` then create your branch based on `master`
  * If the recipe is for Deployer `2.x` then create your branch based on the `2.x` branch
* Add your recipe to the `recipes` folder, it must be licensed as MIT.
* Add documentation in Markdown for your recipe to the `docs` folder, you can base your documentation from [cachetool.md](docs/cachetool.md) as it is fairly complete.
* Add your recipe to the table above in `README.md`, please use alphabetical order.
* Commit, push and send us a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).
* You can use the documentation of your recipe as a description to your pull request.

To ensure a consistent code base, you should make sure the code follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).

### Recipe Do's and Don'ts

For easier integration in existing project, and fewer changes in your recipe and/or docs for it, you should try and follow this general guidelines:

* Use short file names for recipes.  Eg `ftp` instead of `ftp_upload_to_server_recype_by_me`
* Prefix all tasks in recipe with recipe name. if You have task named `mytest` in `myrecipe` it should be named `myrecipe:mytest`
* Use global settings keyed by your recipe name. If You have one setting, name it the same as Your recipe. If You have multiple settings, use associative array
* Use environment variables prefixed by Your recipe name. If You have environment varaible named `better_path` in recipe `myrecipe`, call it `myrecipe_better_path`
* Do not override existing tasks (for example - those in `common.php`). Instead document throughtly how tasks from your recipe can be integrated into workflow
* If your recipe depends on another (be it included in deployer or 3rd party) - document it throughtly. It's better for user to use `require_once` in `deploy.php`, rather than force dependecies.
